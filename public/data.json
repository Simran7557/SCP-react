In case of electrical outage, the emergency barrier between the object and the facility is to be closed and the immediate area evacuated,SCP-002 resembles a tumorous, fleshy growth with a volume of roughly 60 m³ (or 2000 ft³). An iron valve hatch on one side leads to its interior, which appears to be a standard low-rent apartment of modest size. One wall of the room possesses a single window, though no such opening is visible from the exterior. The room contains furniture which, upon close examination, appears to be sculpted bone, woven hair, and various other biological substances produced by the human body. All matter tested thus far show independent or fragmented DNA sequences for each object in the room. SCP-002 is a large, spherical object resembling a furnished living room. It exhibits anomalous properties when individuals enter.",
